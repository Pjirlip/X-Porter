# X-Porter Wordpress plugin

![headerimage](/images/doku-1.png)

Welcome to the X-Porter plugin. With this Wordpress plugin you can export and import headers and footers created 
with the [X Pro Wordpress Theme](https://theme.co/) by Themeco very easily. 

It provides basic export/import functionality for headers and footers. It includes: 
* Menu / Bar / Header / Footer structure
* Buttons
* Images
* Used Colors, explicit ''Template Colors''. 
* Used ''Template Fonts'''
* Custom HTML 
* CSS used in header/footer
* Javascript used in header/footer
* Menu positions and style (but not menus itself, this wouldn't make sense)
* Content areas (with pure HTML. I can't/(don't want to) copy any other plugin elements inserted with shortcodes)
* Search fields
* Defined widget areas (Not the widgets itself)
* Social icons / elements
* Text / Headlines
