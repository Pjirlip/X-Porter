# X-Porter Wordpress plugin

![headerimage](/images/doku-1.png)

Welcome to the X-Porter plugin. With this Worpdress plugin you can easily export and import Headers and Footers created 
with the [X Pro Wordpress Theme](https://theme.co/) by Themeco. 

It provides basic export/import functionality for Headers and Footers. This includes: 
* Menu / Bar / Header / Footer structure
* Buttons
* Images
* Used Colors, explicit ''Theme Colors''. 
* Used Theme Fonts
* Costume HTML 
* In Header/Footer used CSS
* In Header/Footer used Javascript
* Menu positions and styling (But not Menus itself, this wouldn't make much sense)
* Content Areas (With pure HTML. I can't/(do not want) copy any other plugin elements inserted with Shortcodes)
* Search-Fields
* Defined Widget Areas (Not the Widgets itself)
* Social Icons / Elements
* Text / Headlines
